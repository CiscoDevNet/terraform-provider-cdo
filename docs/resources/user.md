## Schema

### Required

- `is_api_only_user` (Boolean) Indicate whether this user is an [API only user](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/cdo/managing-ftd-with-cdo/managing-ftd-with-cisco-defense-orchestrator/basics-of-cisco-defense-orchestrator.html?bookSearch=true#Cisco_Task.dita_d5ae397b-5aa5-4de0-82c1-a4aff63c5ba1)
- `name` (String) The username. If the user is not an [API only user](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/cdo/managing-ftd-with-cdo/managing-ftd-with-cisco-defense-orchestrator/basics-of-cisco-defense-orchestrator.html?bookSearch=true#Cisco_Task.dita_d5ae397b-5aa5-4de0-82c1-a4aff63c5ba1), it must be an e-mail address. Otherwise, it must not be an e-mail address.
- `role` (String) There are a variety of user roles in Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO). User roles are configured for each user on each tenant. Valid Values: (ROLE_READ_ONLY, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN, ROLE_DEPLOY_ONLY, ROLE_EDIT_ONLY, ROLE_VPN_SESSIONS_MANAGER)

### Read-Only

- `generated_username` (String) The username generated by CDO. If the user is an [API only user](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/cdo/managing-ftd-with-cdo/managing-ftd-with-cisco-defense-orchestrator/basics-of-cisco-defense-orchestrator.html?bookSearch=true#Cisco_Task.dita_d5ae397b-5aa5-4de0-82c1-a4aff63c5ba1), the username is appended with the name of the tenant (for example, an API-only user given the name `api_user` in the tenant `example` will have the generated username `api_user@CDO_example`). Otherwise, it is the same as the username entered in the `name` field.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the user. This is a UUID and will be automatically generated when the user is created.
