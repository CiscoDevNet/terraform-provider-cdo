  Provides a Firewall Threat Defense device resource. Use this to onboard, update, and delete FTDs from CDO. This resource does not complete the onboarding of an FTD into CDO and cdFMC. It creates a FTD device entry in the CDO Inventory, and generates a registration command (see the generated_command attribute) that needs to be pasted into the FTD CLI (see step 10 here https://docs.defenseorchestrator.com/c_onboard-an-ftd.html#!t-onboard-an-ftd-device-with-regkey.html). To finish adding the FTD device to CDO and cdFMC, use the cdo_ftd_device_onboarding resource after you have applied this resource.

# cdo_ftd_device (Resource)

Provides a Firewall Threat Defense device resource. Use this to onboard, update, and delete FTDs from CDO. This resource does not complete the onboarding of an FTD into CDO and cdFMC. It creates a FTD device entry in the CDO Inventory, and generates a registration command (see the `generated_command` attribute) that needs to be pasted into the FTD CLI (see **step 10** [here](https://docs.defenseorchestrator.com/c_onboard-an-ftd.html#!t-onboard-an-ftd-device-with-regkey.html)). To finish adding the FTD device to CDO and cdFMC, use the `cdo_ftd_device_onboarding` resource after you have applied this resource.
